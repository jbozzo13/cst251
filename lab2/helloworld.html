		<h1>Hello World</h1>

		<p>My name is Haley and I am a Communication Design major with a concentration
				in Visual Design. I'm currently living in Groveland, a small mountain town
				in the Sierra Foothills. I have a long-haired siamese cat named Appa, he's
				my baby. I am also a plant mom and am one of those people who bought way
				too many plants during quarantine. I have absolutely no experience in coding,
				but am looking forward to learning.</p>

		<p>My name is Julia (she/her) and I'm a second year CD student at CSUMB.
				I've lived in San Jose my whole life. I spend most of my time making music
			 	and art, and I kind of have a thrifting addiction. Like Haley, I have also
				adopted many plants over this quarantine! I'm excited but a little nervous
				to start learning about code, since it is an area I have no experience in.</p>
