<h1>Lab 9: Styling Block Elements</h1>
  <p>In this lab, I experimented more with css and learned more about
    styling blocks on my webpage.</p>
<h2>Difficulties</h2>
  <p>This lab was not as intimidating since I now have some more
  experience with css from previous labs, but it brought the new challenge of discovering
  how to achieve new results with css.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
  <p>What you are seeing is an index.html with block styling
    from the index.css that I wrote the code for.</p>
