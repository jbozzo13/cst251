    Hi! My name is Julia and this is my website!
    I love playing animal crossing and watching sailor moon ;)
    I also like to make music and art!
    I have 2 cats but they don't like me very much :(

<h1>Lab 11:<br>
  Advanced Block-Level Styling</h1>
  <p>In this lab, I experimented with block level styling.</p>
<h2>♡Difficulties♡</h2>
  <p>This lab was much more difficult than the previous
  few labs, since I've never created a sidebar before and
  I was unsure how to do so.</p>
<h2>♡Results♡</h2>
  <p>What you are seeing is an index.html with
    more advanced block styling from the index.css
    that I wrote the code for.</p>
