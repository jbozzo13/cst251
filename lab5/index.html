	<h1>Lab 5: More Html</h1>
	<p>In this lab, I created a webpage with images and links to other web pages</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p>This lab was pretty similar to the previous two labs, so i was able to get through it pretty easily.
		Though, I made many tiny mistakes in my code that were easily fixed with a little testing.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>I was able to add images and links to websites on this site! Below are 2 of my album covers,
		 that will take you to their respective pages on spotify when clicked on.<p/>
