<h1>Lab 7: Intro to CSS</h1>
  <p> The objective of this lab was to get even more experience writing
    CSS code in order to stylize our HTML.</p>
<h2>Difficulties</h2>
  <p>While starting this lab, I was hesitant and intimidated by writing
    CSS code. After reviewing my notes and testing the code in the browser
    countless times, I finally figured it out.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
  <p>What you are seeing is an index.html styles with the index.css that
    I wrote the code for. </p>
