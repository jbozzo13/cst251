	<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
	<p>In this lab, I worked on testing local files and uploading them to a server</p>
	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p>since I now have a little more experience with basic html,
		I did not have as many difficulties or make little mistakes as I did in previous labs.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>I ended up executing the lab pretty easily.<p/>
